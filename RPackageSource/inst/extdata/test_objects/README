The .rda files in this folder were created from saving objects created in the COMETS vignette. 
The objects are returned from the functions readCOMETSinput, getModelData, runCorr, and runModel.
They serve as the baseline objects for the unit tests in the /tests/testthat folder. 
The unit tests are automatically run when R CMD check is invoked on the COMETS package.

History:
2021-05-17 New test object files were created due to the change in output columns on the
           returned data frames from runModel. These changes are associated with the new
           output options output.Effects and output.ModelSummary.
