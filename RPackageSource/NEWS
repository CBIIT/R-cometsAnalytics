CHANGES IN VERSION 3.0.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Meta-analyses can now be performed using the runAllMeta and runMeta functions. 
    o The Models sheet of the input Excel file now has an "EXPOSURE_REFERENCE" column to specify the reference level of a categorical variable.
    o The VarMap sheet of the input Excel file now has an "ACCEPTED_VALUES" column to specify the valid values for each variable.
    o The readCOMETSinput function now has the argument mode ("Interactive" or "Batch") for the model in which it is called.
    o The ModelSummary table now has a column called "exposure.covariances" containing exposure covariances for categorical exposures and non-correlation models.
    o The function plotMissvalues has been added to plot the distribution of missing values in metabolites.
    o A chemical enrichment analysis can be performed using the option "chemEnrich" or calling the  chemClassEnrichment function.
    o Adjusted p-values have been added to the Effects and ModelSummary tables, see option method.adjP:value.
    o The runModel() function now has a "writeTofile" argument.
    o The options "cohorts.indep" and "cohorts.merge" were added for meta-analyses.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Survival and conditional logistic regression models are now included for analyses. See NOTES.
    o The output from runModel now includes a "Table 1" data frame containing summary information for model variables. 
    o The output from runModel now includes an "Info" data frame containing model and session information. 
    o Options for merging model results together and specifying the type of output file are now available.

NOTES

    o For correlation analyses the "corr" column in the Effects data frame has been renamed to "estimate".
    o For survival models in batch mode, set the FUNCTION column in the MODEL_TYPES sheet to coxph and set the TIME column in the MODELS sheet to the time-to-event variable.
    o For conditional logistic models in batch mode, set the FUNCTION column in the MODEL_TYPES sheet to clogit and set the GROUP column in the MODELS sheet to the matched set variable.
    o The runCorr function is now deprecated. In interactive mode, use the runModel function instead. In batch mode, use FUNCTION=correlation.


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Generalized linear models are now included for analyses. 
    o User-controlled options are now available.
    o Output is now written to Excel files.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.0
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o The t-statistic computation for unadjusted correlation analyses has been updated.
    o Correlation analyses with categorical variables have been fixed.

NOTES

    o Correlation results will be the same with version 1.6 for adjusted models with ALL continuous (non-dummy) variables.
    o Correlation results will NOT be the same with version 1.6 for any categorical exposure.
